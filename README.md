## Key Takeaways

- Positioning items on a webpage so that they remain stable upon window resizing. 
- Using Z-Index to layer items.
- Improving UX through button:hover effects and box shadows. 

## Areas for Improvement

Next time I would use CSS Grid to segment the page in a more efficient way. I will also look further into methods of stabilizing the positioning of the logo and photo caption when the window is resized.
